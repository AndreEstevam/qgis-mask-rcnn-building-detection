name=Building Detector
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Applys the mask r-cnn algorithm to detect and segment buildings.
version=0.1
author=Andr√© Estevam Costa Oliveira
email=andre.estevam.unb@gmail.com

about=This plugin applys the algorithm "Mask R-CNN" to a given raster and outputs a vector file and, optionally, a image file containing the inferenced mask. The user has the option to set a threshold, which the algorithm uses to "filter" low-probability detections, being 0.5 the default. All pre-processing steps as well as inference and output formatting will be carried out automatically, without the need of user interference.
